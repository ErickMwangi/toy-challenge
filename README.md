## Learning Goals

- Understand how to solve problem in JavaScript


## Instructions

challenge1 grading calculator: In this challenge theres the calling of if else statement. This function takes a mark as an input and returns the corresponding grade based on the criteria provided. The main program prompts the user to input a mark between 0 and 100.it checks if the input is valid that is between 0 and 100 and calls the 'calculate_grade'function.Finally,it prints the mark and corresponnding grade if the input is valid, it raises a 'value errror' with a custom message that is caught and printed by the 'except' block.
one could modify this code to allow the user to input multiple marks, by using a loop and a list to store the marks and grades.

challenge2 speed detector : in this challenge when you run the code, it will prompt you to enter the speed of a car. Oce you enter the speed and click ok, the function will calculate the number of points and print itnto the console.Note the function assumes that the user will enter a valid input,the function may not behave as expected. to handle this, you can add additional error-checking code to the function.

challenge3 net-salary: In this challenge we begin by identifying some of the existing loops.the code defines a function called `calculateTax` which takes two arguments, `grossSalary` and `benefits` and calculates the net pay after deducting taxes such as KRA tax,NSSF tax, and NHIF tax. the `calcKra`, `calcNSSF` and `calcNHIF` functions are used to calculate the taxes. The code then calls the `calculateTax` function with `grossSalary and `benefits` and stores the result in the variable `final_net`. finally it prints the result to the console using `console.log()`.
